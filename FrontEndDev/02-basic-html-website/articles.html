            <p>Democracy as a form of government relies on an informed public. The founders of democracy in the United States, which became a model for much of the world, recognized the connection between democracy and the press when writing the U.S. Constitution. Freedom of the press became one of the five pillars in the very first amendment to the Constitution. 
                Moreover, one of the first acts was to establish an inexpensive postal system, in part so that newspapers could be distributed cheaply. 
                But now we have an upside down world. Through the internet and the magic of artificial intelligence, news can be delivered at an insignificant cost, resulting in so many news sources that many people shut news out all together or are confused by it and distrust it. 
                To see what affect this cacophony of information has on democracy, News Decoder convened two experts in journalism and three high school students for our most recent Decoder Dialogue, a monthly live video conference series. And we posed this question: In defending democracy, does journalism matter? 
                “A healthy mainstream press is definitely one of the pillars of democracy because it gives people the hard naked truth in order to be able to make informed decisions,” said Alexandru Ciocan, the editor​-in​-chief of Gen, revistă, a youth-produced magazine​ in Romania. “You have to be correctly informed and you have to have a multitude of perspectives and opinions and a good, healthy press does that.”</p>
